// Hand-authored `reads: []` veto for `motion-utils@12.39.0`, on the published
// `.` runtime case
// `artifact-case:9a3a41a5f9148fb1f1e9175f5bea89d05e24dbd149c9629a9f4cf615fc6cfcc1`
// -- the dependency node the motion-solidjs rows certify through.
//
// Why this recipe is allowed to be this short: the artifact case carries no
// `runtime-accessor-installation` closure hazard, so the census states
// syntactically that `dist/es/index.mjs` installs no accessor and there is no
// trap here for the recipe to count (§ 12 of
// `docs/package-contract-v2/phase21/2026-09-10-reads-veto-observation-design.md`).
// The hazard does the work an observation counter used to. What is left is
// what a mandatory veto is for: sample the export and emit only on
// contradiction.
//
// It hands the package no `session` and no `harness`.
//
// `anticipate(p)` is arithmetic over one number, delegating to `backIn` for
// the first half. No member of anything this module built is read.
