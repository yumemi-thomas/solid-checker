 * parent is disposed; call `dispose()` to tear it down earlier. To create a
 * root that outlives its creator, detach explicitly:
 * `runWithOwner(null, () => createRoot(...))`. Pass `id` to seed hydration
 * ids for the tree it owns.
 *
 * `dispose()` tears down every signal, memo, effect, and `onCleanup`
 * registered inside the root.

 * Use this to host long-lived reactive scopes outside of a component (custom
 * controllers, app bootstrapping, tests). Inside a component, prefer
 * letting Solid's component lifecycle own things.

 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // At module level there is no owner, so this root lives until disposed.
 * const dispose = createRoot(dispose => {
 *   const [n, setN] = createSignal(0);
 *   createEffect(() => n(), value => console.log(value));
 *   setInterval(() => setN(x => x + 1), 1000);
 *   return dispose;
 * });
 *
 * // Later, to tear everything down:
 * dispose();
 *
 * // Inside an owner (component, effect, another root), detach explicitly
 * // if the root must outlive its creator:
 * const detached = runWithOwner(null, () => createRoot(d => d));
 * ```
