/**
 * The primitive for mutations: imperative async workflows whose *writes span
 * an async gap* — optimistic write, server round-trip, reconciling write —
 * where intermediate state must not leak and failure must revert cleanly
 * (pair with `createOptimistic` / `createOptimisticStore`).
 *
 * Navigation-shaped updates do not need an action. A plain setter call is
 * enough: reads pull the async, and downstream async computeds hold their
 * previous values per-node until the new ones are ready (`isPending` /
 * `latest` expose the in-flight state). Reach for `action` only when writes
 * happen *after* async work, not merely upstream of it.
 *
 * Framework-level actions (router form actions, server actions) are
 * specializations of this primitive: they are actions in exactly this sense —
 * the same transactional semantics — with form binding, serialization, and
 * submission tracking layered on top. The shared name is deliberate.
 *
 * Wraps a generator function so each invocation runs as a single transaction
 * (a "transition") that batches every signal/store write between yields. The
 * surrounding UI sees one atomic update per yielded step; nothing is committed
 * until the action either completes or the next `yield` resolves.
 *
 * `yield` is the transaction-safe suspension point: the action waits for a
 * yielded promise and re-enters the transaction before running the code after
 * it. A plain `await` does NOT — the runtime has no hook into an async
 * generator's internal await continuations, so code between an `await` and
 * the next `yield` runs OUTSIDE the transaction: writes to fresh signals
 * commit immediately, and anything that creates a reader there — `until()`,
 * `latest()`, a memo or effect, a mount — is created mainline, where a read of
 * this action's held state makes it born held (A29): staged with the
 * transaction and replayed at its commit. For `until()` that commit is the
 * settle its own promise holds open (#3482). `await` is still the ergonomic
 * choice for typed results; just put a bare `yield` before any write or
 * reader creation that follows it — including the expression of the next
 * `yield`, which is evaluated before the step re-enters:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const saved = await api.createTodo(text); // typed result
 * yield; // re-enter the transaction before writing or reading
 * setTodos(t => { ... });
 * yield until(() => todos.some(t => t.id === saved.id));
 * ```
 *
 * (For the same reason, don't call `flush()` inside an action body — it
 * drains the transaction mid-step.)
 *
 * Each call returns a `Promise` that resolves with the generator's return
 * value, or rejects if it throws. Pair with `createOptimistic` /
 * `createOptimisticStore` to apply tentative writes that auto-revert if the
 * action fails.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const [todos, setTodos] = createOptimisticStore<Todo[]>([]);
 *
 * const addTodo = action(async function* (text: string) {
 *   const tempId = crypto.randomUUID();
 *   setTodos(t => { t.push({ id: tempId, text, pending: true }); }); // optimistic
 *   const saved = await api.createTodo(text); // network round-trip, typed
 *   yield; // re-enter the transaction
 *   setTodos(t => {
 *     const i = t.findIndex(x => x.id === tempId);
 *     if (i >= 0) t[i] = saved;
 *   });
 *   return saved;
 * });
 *
 * await addTodo("buy milk");
 * ```
