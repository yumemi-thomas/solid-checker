# missing-owner

`SC4001` · **warning** by default · violation (uncertifiable, reported as an error, when required ownership facts are unresolved)

An owner-requiring operation executes without a reactive owner. The rule covers
effects, cleanup registration, `Loading`/`Errored` boundaries, and an `onSettled`
callback that returns cleanup. Its message identifies the specific operation.

## What it does

The checker reports an operation when no component, computation, or root owner
dominates it. Typical sites are module scope, bare helpers called from module
scope, and detached callbacks. Exported functions with unseen callers, nullable
`runWithOwner` values, unresolved component identity, and unresolved runtime
allocation paths are uncertifiable rather than proven violations.

The proven `onSettled` cleanup variant has **error** severity because Solid 2.0
throws `SETTLED_CLEANUP_UNOWNED` in development and silently drops the cleanup
in production. Other proven variants are warnings: an effect keeps its
subscriptions, `onCleanup` has nowhere to register, or a boundary subtree can
never be disposed.

## Examples

Incorrect:

```tsx
createEffect(() => syncTheme(theme()));
onCleanup(() => window.removeEventListener("resize", resize));

const orphan = <Loading fallback={<Spinner />}><Profile /></Loading>;

onSettled(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(poll, 5000);
  return () => clearInterval(timer);
});
```

Correct:

```tsx
function App() {
  createEffect(() => syncTheme(theme()));
  onCleanup(() => window.removeEventListener("resize", resize));
  return <Loading fallback={<Spinner />}><Profile /></Loading>;
}

const dispose = createRoot((dispose) => {
  onSettled(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(poll, 5000);
    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  });
  return dispose;
});
```

## How to fix

Create the operation inside a component or computation, or wrap deliberate
standalone setup in `createRoot` and retain its dispose callback. Do not return
cleanup from an ownerless event-handler `onSettled`; tear it down explicitly.
For exported library helpers, describe the ownership requirement in the
package's reactivity contract so callers can be certified.
