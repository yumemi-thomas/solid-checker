# solid-checker migration

The package-contract generator can remove these heuristics after consuming the
new facts:

- Regex and rendered-type checks for function-like syntax: demand
  `callability`.
- `TypeDescriptor.text` and `typeToString` interpretation for callability:
  use the callability enum.
- Synthetic probe calls and diagnostic filtering: demand `resolvedCall` and
  accept only `valid`.
- Source-text searches that decide whether an import is type-only or runtime:
  demand `referenceSpace`.
- Regex parsing of export declarations and module specifiers to join aliases:
  compare non-empty `runtimeIdentity` values.
- Declaration-name plus declaration-file checks such as `"getItem"` in
  `lib.dom.d.ts`: compare the selected declaration symbol and owner chain from
  `resolvedCall.declaration`. `qualifiedName` is useful for logs, not equality.
- Overload guessing and positional argument heuristics: consume each
  `resolvedCall.arguments` entry and use its selected parameter symbol,
  declaration, instantiated type, rest/optional flags, and callability.
- Synthetic or best-effort mapping for recovery, union-composite, and spread
  calls: honor the explicit unresolved mapping reason instead.

`returnTypeText` remains presentation data. It must not be used to decide any
of the facts above. The new facts also do not authorize a callback-timing
contract: invocation timing is runtime behavior that TypeScript does not prove.
